Hi, I’m Sanidhya Mall — an aspiring cybersecurity professional passionate about ethical hacking and system defense. I enjoy solving CTF challenges, exploring real-world vulnerabilities, and building tools with Python. Currently pursuing my MCA with a focus on cybersecurity, I'm constantly learning and aiming to contribute to secure systems.

## Objective
My objective is to secure an entry level cybersecurity role such as SOC Analyst or Junior Penetration Tester, where I can leverage my hands‑on experience in ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, and CTF challenges, while continuing to grow technically and help strengthen an organization’s security posture.
